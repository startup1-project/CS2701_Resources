This folder contains materials for the Week 5 and Week 7 labs.

- The HTML, CSS and JS files are the solution for the Week 5 lab.
- They demonstrate the completed layout, styling and validation for that week's (Week 5) exercise.
- These files also form the starter code for the Week 7 lab, and are ready for conversion to React.
